## Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js).

Steps to deploy:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Import your repository to Vercel: https://vercel.com/new
3. Vercel will automatically detect that you're using Next.js and will set up the optimal build settings for you.
4. Your application will be deployed and available at a unique URL immediately.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from the command line:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```
